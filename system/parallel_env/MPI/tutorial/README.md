# Simple MPI tutorial

### Setup

Open your terminal and cd to this dir. Then create a dir `build` for local compiled executable. 

```bash
$ cd /<your_work_dir_path>/Knowledge-Base/system/parallel_env/MPI/tutorial
$ mkdir ../build
```

---

### Env Check

Now please try to compile and run the `hello_mpi.cc`  to test if your MPI env is ready. Use the folowing command. You are expected to see something similar to the lines below in you terminal. 

```bash
$ mpicc hello_mpi.cc -o build/hello_mpi
$ mpirun -n 2 ../build/hello_mpi  # n stands for the number process to create
Hello world from processor <host_name_if_using_mac>, rank 1 out of 2 processors
Hello world from processor <host_name_if_using_mac>, rank 0 out of 2 processors
```

If you do, you are all set to move on. If not, try to check google with the error message or roll back to reinstall MPI releases.

### Blocking point-to-point communication

#### MPI Send and Receive

Sending and receiving are the two foundational concepts of MPI. Almost every single function in MPI can be implemented with basic send and receive calls. I will discuss how to use MPIâ€™s blocking sending and receiving functions, and I will also overview other basic concepts associated with transmitting data using MPI.

#### Dynamic Receiving with MPI Probe (and MPI Status)

MPI natively supports dynamic messages with just a few additional function calls.
