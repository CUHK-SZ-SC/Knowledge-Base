# C Family Language & Tool Introduction

### Basic Concept

C

    C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 
    
    C standard: ANSI C(C89 and C90) ; C99 ; C11 ; C18
    
C++

    C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985 
    
    C++ is an extension of the C programming language
    
    C++ standard: C++98 ; C++03 ; C++11 ; C++14 ; C++17 ; C++20
    
GCC

    The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) was developed by the GNU Project in 1987
    
    GCC is a compiler system supporting various programming languages
    
    GCC verion: 7.4 ; 8.3 ; 9.2 ; 10.0

Make

    Make was developed at Bell Labs by Stuart Feldman in 1976

    Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries
    
    Make version: 3.82 ; 4.2.1
    
SSE

    SSE was first designed by Intel and introduced in the Pentium III in 1999
    
    Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) is a set of CPU instructions dedicated to applications like signal processing, scientific computation or 3D graphics
    
    Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) is a CPU structure where same operation is applied on multiple data at the same time

    SSE version: MMX ; SSE ; SSE2 ; SSE3 ; SSSE3 ; SSE4 ; SSE5 ; AVX ; XOP ; FMA
